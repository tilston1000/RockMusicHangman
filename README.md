As I'm delving further into the world of JS, I've developed a simple Hangman game, based on some of the knowledge I have acquired so far. Some of the key elements that make up this game are:
- Incorporating event listeners into the html, specifically around "click" events, so that functions can be invoked after these events are called
- Starting to look at more complex functions; notably, in this project, the 'builder' function implements the initial functionality of building out the(hidden) rock band name, together with 'A-Z' options so that the player can guess the letters in the band name
- Making use of the 'style' properties, so that "out of the box", repeatable classes can be built, and called via function invocation
- General DOM manipulation
  
I deliberately coded this in Notepad++, with the html page running concurrently alongside it. With the console window open in the browser(Chrome > Dev Tools in my case), I could see any mis-steps I'd made with the code, as they would be highlighted as errors. This was a really beneficial exercise and solidified my understanding even more. Obviously, we'd probably look to use an IDE like VS Code for this, but in my view, it can be helpful to work with a completely blank canvas.

Good luck, for anyone who has a go at my Rock Music Hangman Game ðŸŽ¸! Although, I'm appreciative you might have to be a bit old, like me, to guess the band names ðŸ˜†
